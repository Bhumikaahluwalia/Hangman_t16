                                                          DESCRIPTION:
                                                          
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. This project consists of six versions of the Hangman game, each version introducing new features, improvements, and fixes.
Version 1
Version 1 of the Hangman game Designed by Bhawna, offers a traditional setup with features such as "Start Game," "Good luck with the game," "Submit Guess",” Hint if guess is wrong” and a prompt message for incorrect guesses.

Version 2
Designed by an unspecified creator, has undergone some revisions. It no longer includes the "Start Game" or "Good luck with the game" messages. Instead, it features "Missed Letters" tracking, a "Keyboard" interface for input, and a "Game Over" prompt that reveals the correct answer. Here's an extended version based on the provided statements:

Game 2, crafted with precision by an adept designer, distinguishes itself by its streamlined interface. Gone are the redundant niceties of wishing players good fortune, for it trusts in their own prowess. Instead, it focuses on functionality, offering a meticulous log of missed letters to aid players in their quest. The keyboard, an intuitive tool at players' fingertips, serves as their conduit to victory.

Yet, should defeat rear its head, the game graciously reveals the answer, guiding players toward enlightenment. In this iteration, simplicity reigns supreme, allowing the challenge itself to shine without adornment.

Version 3
Version 3 Designed with precision, offers players a straightforward yet engaging experience. It begins with clear instructions, setting the stage for the challenge ahead. A message of "Good luck with the game" serves as a gentle encouragement before embarking on the journey.
Throughout the game, players have the opportunity to restart their efforts with a dedicated button, ensuring a seamless experience. As they navigate the word puzzle, a helpful hint emerges when four letters are guessed incorrectly, guiding them back on track.
However, should their attempts fall short, the game gracefully concludes with a final message, revealing the elusive answer and inviting players to try again.

Version 4
Version 4 Takes the foundation laid by its predecessor and expands upon it with additional features. The inclusion of a "Start" button offers players control over when to begin their adventure, while the familiar instructions and good luck messages provide a reassuring familiarity.

In this iteration, the game interface evolves further, with missed letters visibly marked and a cross indicating incorrect guesses. The hint system remains intact, offering guidance when needed most. And when the challenge becomes too great, an "End Game" button allows players to gracefully exit, with the answer revealed in the game over message.

Deadline: [Insert Deadline Date]
Version 1 was completed before the deadline, showcasing the dedication and commitment of the developer to meet project milestones.

Version 5
Brings a vibrant twist to the traditional word puzzle experience, enhancing the visual appeal with a burst of colors. While maintaining the essential elements of instructions and good luck messages, it introduces a dynamic aesthetic that captivates players from the start.

The hint system remains a stalwart companion, guiding players through the intricacies of the puzzle. And when the journey reaches its conclusion, an "End Game" button offers closure, signaling the end of one adventure and the potential beginning of another.

Version 6
players are presented with a choice from a selection of themes: fruits, animals, or countries. This thematic element adds a layer of intrigue, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferences.

As players progress, their scores accumulate, providing a tangible measure of their success. And when the game reaches its climax, both an "End Game" and "Restart Game" button offer players the freedom to choose their next steps, ensuring that the adventure is never truly over.
