Version 2

Here's an extended version based on the provided statements.
Game 2, crafted with precision by an adept designer, distinguishes itself by its streamlined interface. Gone are the redundant niceties of wishing players good fortune, for it trusts in their own prowess. Instead, it focuses on functionality, offering a meticulous log of missed letters to aid players in their quest. The keyboard, an intuitive tool at players' fingertips, serves as their conduit to victory.

Yet, should defeat rear its head, the game graciously reveals the answer, guiding players toward enlightenment. In this iteration, simplicity reigns supreme, allowing the challenge itself to shine without adornment.
